# ZGW-specifieke regels
#
# Deze regels controleren op correct gebruik van inheritance patterns en
# discriminators in de ZGW APIs.

functions:
  - discriminatorPropertyExists
functionsDir: "./functions"

rules:
  # Rule 1: Ensures that any schema using a discriminator also uses oneOf
  # Example:
  #   discriminator:  # If this exists...
  #     propertyName: type
  #   oneOf: []       # ...this must also exist
  discriminator-requires-oneof:
    description: Schemas with discriminators must use oneOf for polymorphism
    message: "When using a discriminator, 'oneOf' must be specified."
    severity: error
    given: "$.components.schemas[?(@.discriminator)]"
    then:
      field: oneOf
      function: truthy

  # Rule 2: Ensures that any schema using oneOf also uses a discriminator
  # Example:
  #   oneOf: []       # If this exists...
  #   discriminator:  # ...this must also exist
  #     propertyName: type
  oneof-requires-discriminator:
    description: oneOf must use discriminator for proper type selection
    message: "When using 'oneOf', a 'discriminator' must be specified."
    severity: error
    given: "$.components.schemas[?(@.oneOf)]"
    then:
      field: discriminator
      function: truthy

  # Rule 3: Ensures that discriminators have proper mappings defined
  # Example:
  #   discriminator:
  #     propertyName: type
  #     mapping:      # This must exist
  #       type1: '#/components/schemas/Type1'
  #       type2: '#/components/schemas/Type2'
  discriminator-mapping-required:
    description: Discriminators must include explicit mappings
    message: "Discriminator must include a 'mapping' object."
    severity: error
    given: "$.components.schemas.*.discriminator"
    then:
      field: mapping
      function: truthy

  # Rule 4: Ensures that discriminator propertyName is properly defined
  # Example:
  #   discriminator:
  #     propertyName: myType  # Must exist and not be empty
  #   properties:
  #     myType:               # This field must exist
  #       type: string

    description: Discriminator must have a valid propertyName
    message: "{{error}}"
