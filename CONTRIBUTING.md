# Contributing

We – [VNG realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/) and the maintainers of this project – know we
can only create this standard together with you. Thus we appreciate your input, enjoy feedback and
welcome improvements to this project and are very open to collaboration.

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.

## Problems, suggestions and questions in Issues

You don't need to change any of our code or documentation to be a contributor. Please help
development by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions. To do this, you can
[create a GitHub Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) for this project in the
[GitHub Issues for VNG-Realisatie/gemma-zaken](https://github.com/VNG-Realisatie/gemma-zaken/issues).

## Documentation and code in Pull Requests

If you want to add to the documentation or code of one of our projects you should make a Pull
Request. If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with
[Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### 1. Make your changes

This project uses the **OneFlow branching model** and workflow. When you've forked this repository,
please make sure to create a feature branch following the OneFlow model. Read this
[short blogpost](http://endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) when you're
not yet familiar with OneFlow.

Add your changes in commits
[with a message that explains them](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to be
informed of your choices in the future.

If you are adding code, make sure you've added and updated the relevant documentation and tests
before you submit your pull request. Make sure to write tests that show the behaviour of the newly
added or changed code.

### 2. Pull Request

When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are
trying to address and the issue numbers that this Pull Request fixes/addresses.

### 3. Improve

All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer. However, usually, a
new Pull Request needs some improvements before it can be merged. Other contributors (or helper
robots) might have feedback. If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your
documentation and code.

If your documentation and code have passed human review and have passed the automated tests, it is
merged.

### 4. Celebrate

Your ideas, documentation and code have become an integral part of this project. You are the Open
Source hero we need.
